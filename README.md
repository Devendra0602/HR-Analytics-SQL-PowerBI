# HR Analytics Dashboard (SQL Server & Power BI)

This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition using SQL Server and Power BI.
The goal was to understand workforce trends such as attrition rate, department-wise turnover,
age group distribution, and job satisfaction.

## Tools Used
- SQL Server
- Power BI
- IBM HR Analytics Dataset

## Project Workflow
1. Imported HR employee data into SQL Server
2. Performed basic data exploration using SQL queries
3. Created a base SQL view with derived columns such as:
   - Age Group
   - Attrition Flag
4. Used SQL views and queries to calculate key HR metrics
5. Connected Power BI directly to SQL Server
6. Built an interactive dashboard for visualization

## Key Insights
- Overall employee attrition rate
- Departments with higher attrition
- Age groups most affected by attrition
- Gender distribution of employees
- Relationship between job satisfaction and attrition
